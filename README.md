This is a brief bit of hacking on the MuteSync button so that I could work out and prototype some alternate switching and illumination. Thanks to Tom at MuteSync for filling me in on what the serial protocol was. I then put this bit of Go together to find the MuteSync on USB, flutter its lights and respond to being pressed and released. It should be fairly obvious, if you want it to do more, where to put your action code (hint, buttonPressed and buttonReleased).

Have fun!
